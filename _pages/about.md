I am a FNRS Research associate ("chercheur qualifi√©")  at the [Namur Digital Institute (NADI)](https://nadi.unamur.be) and the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.unamur.be/en/inf) of the University of Namur in Belgium. After I received my PhD jointly from the Universities of Luxembourg and Namur in 2007, I held several postdoctoral positions at the universities of Rennes, Luxembourg and Namur. My research interests involve quality assurance of variability-intensive, intelligent, complex systems and software testing techniques to achieve more ethical and sustainable machine learning. I am a member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) and [ACM](https://www.acm.org).
