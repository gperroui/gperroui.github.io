I am thrilled to have received on September 5 the Most influential paper award at the 28th International 28TH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINE CONFERENCE [SPLC 2024](https://2024.splc.net) !

The awarded paper was published at the ICST 2010 conference when I was a postdoctoral researcher at the university of Luxembourg. The paper was entitled "Automated and Scalable T-wise Test Case Generation Strategies for Software Product Lines" and was authored by par Gilles Perrouin, Sagar Sen, Jacques Klein, Benoit Baudry, Yves Le Traon. This paper adapted combinatorial interaction testing and SAT solving in an end-to-end model-driven framework to sample configurations to test in software product lines covering interactions between features. This paper opened the way to many sucessful sampling strategies, notably exploiting the concept of configuration redundancy/similarity.
