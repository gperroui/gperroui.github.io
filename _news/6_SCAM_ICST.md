I am delighted to announce that I have joined the programme committees of the [24th IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2024)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/scam-2024) and the [18th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST) 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icst-2025)! Looking forward to read your best papers in source code manipulation and testing.
