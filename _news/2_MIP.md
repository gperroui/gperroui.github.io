I am hounoured to have received on this day the 10-year MOST influential paper award at 18th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems [VAMOS 2024](https://vamos2024.inf.unibe.ch) !

Our paper published in 2014 when VAMOS was in Nice, is entitled: "Towards statistical prioritization for software product lines testing". It is joint work with my colleagues Xavier Devroey, Maxime Cordy, Pierre-Yves Schobbens, Axel Legay, and Patrick Heymans. In short, it bridges the idea of statistical testing, which prioritizes tests based on usage of the software with the selection of products to test in software product lines. A detailed account of this award can be found on the [SNAIL Lab website](https://snail.info.unamur.be/post/2024-02-08-mip-vamos/).
