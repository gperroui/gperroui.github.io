The paper was entitled “Automated and Scalable T-wise Test Case Generation Strategies for Software Product Lines” and was authored by par Gilles Perrouin, Sagar Sen, Jacques Klein, Benoit Baudry, Yves Le Traon. This paper adapted combinatorial interaction testing and SAT solving in an end-to-end model-driven framework to sample configurations to test in software product lines covering interactions between features. This paper opened the way to many sucessful sampling strategies, notably exploiting the concept of configuration redundancy/similarity.</p> <p>The slides of the presentation I made for the reception of the award are available <a href="/assets/pdf/SPLC2024-MIP-169-FINAL.pdf">here</a></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/SPLC2024_MIP_award_diploma.JPG" alt="Most Influential Paper Award - SPLC 2024" width="600px"/> <img src="/assets/img/Gilles_presentation_MIP.JPG" alt="Most Influential Paper Award - SPLC 2024 - Presentation" width="600px"/> <img src="/assets/img/Award-Photo_website.JPG" alt="Most Influential Paper Award - SPLC 2024 - Authors Photo" width="600px"/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="conferences"/><category term="awards"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I received the Most Influential Paper Award at VAMOS 2024</title><link href="https://gperroui.github.io/blog/2024/MIP-VAMOS2024/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I received the Most Influential Paper Award at VAMOS 2024"/><published>2024-02-08T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-08T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://gperroui.github.io/blog/2024/MIP-VAMOS2024</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gperroui.github.io/blog/2024/MIP-VAMOS2024/"><![CDATA[<p>I am hounoured to have received on this day the 10-year MOST influential paper award at 18th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems <a href="https://vamos2024.inf.unibe.ch">VAMOS 2024</a> !</p> <p>Our paper published in 2014 when VAMOS was in Nice, is entitled: “Towards statistical prioritization for software product lines testing”. It is joint work with my colleagues Xavier Devroey, Maxime Cordy, Pierre-Yves Schobbens, Axel Legay, and Patrick Heymans. In short, it bridges the idea of statistical testing, which prioritizes tests based on usage of the software with the selection of products to test in software product lines.
